# Flood-Detection-Using-Logistic-Regression
<br>
## Dataset:
Selected a publicly available dataset from kaggle and considered the factors such as dataset popularity. After selecting the datasets, downloaded and stored them on the local machine which is my laptop "Asus Vivobook 14".
<br>
## Perform Data Analysis:
Surfed the dataset throughly and displayed its basic information. Checked for missing (null) values and handled them appropriately. Also checked for duplicate entries in the dataset. If the dataset had any categorical variables (e.g., labels like 'Yes' or 'No', or different categories of items), converted them to numerical values.
<br>
## Visualization:
Using the correlation matrix, examined how numerical features relate to one another. Features that are strongly correlated might provide important insights into the behavior of the data. Next, Created visualizations to gain insights into the dataset. Used various types of plots, such as: Bar plots, Count plots, Histogram, Pie charts, Scatter plots etc. These visualizations will helps to gain insights into the data and highlight any trends or patterns.

## Machine Learning Model:
Need to run at least one machine learning algorithm (Logistic Regression or Linear Regression) on the dataset. Evaluate the performance using an accuracy metric (accuracy score, confusion matrix, etc.). Optionally, can run additional machine learning algorithms (e.g., SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest etc.), but this is not mandatory.
